# TradingDashboard Project Status 
Last updated: Wed 03/26/2025  0:03:33.74 
 
## Project Description 
This is a trading system for recommending Flazh Infinity parameters and ATM settings based on market conditions for NinjaTrader 8, focusing on NQ futures. 
 
## Instructions for Assistants 
IMPORTANT - Please read these notes carefully before helping: 
 
- I am not a coder and get confused easily with technical jargon 
- When sharing code changes, please provide complete files rather than snippets to replace 
- Take things slow and easy, focusing on one task at a time 
- Do not overload me with multiple blocks of code all at once 
- Always include the exact full file path when I need to create new files 
- Be explicit about file locations and command line instructions 
- After completing a task, I will show you a list of newly created files to verify correct locations 
- After task completion, we will run system tests to ensure everything is functioning properly 
- I want to work on one item at a time - please don't try to implement multiple features simultaneously 
- When providing code, list the file name, path, and complete code block 
- If a file's code is very long, separate it into 2 or more logical blocks with clear instructions on where to place each block 
- This prevents chat sessions from stopping mid-code and makes implementation easier 
- Before making changes to existing files, ask to see the current file contents first to ensure compatibility 
- Review the current project structure and state before suggesting new implementations 
- Suggest any necessary preparation steps before adding new features to avoid system errors 
- Remember I am not even a novice coder, so explain concepts very simply and proceed carefully 
- NEVER create code that bypasses MongoDB database access with mock data. The system must always use the real MongoDB database 
- If MongoDB connection issues occur, focus on fixing the connection rather than implementing workarounds 
- The MarketDataExporter indicator from NinjaTrader automatically writes data to a JSON file which is then read by the server and stored in MongoDB - maintain this flow in all modifications 
- Any temporary mock data or bypass code for testing must be clearly marked and include instructions for removing it once the real data access is working 
 
## Post-Task Verification 
For each completed task: 
1. Run 'dir [new_directory] /s /b' to verify new files are in the correct location 
2. Run appropriate system tests (when applicable): 
   - For server components: 'npm test' or 'node server.js' to verify functionality 
   - For database updates: Verify MongoDB connections and data integrity 
   - For API endpoints: Test with Postman or curl commands 
 
## Project Structure 
The project is organized in a modular architecture with server components and integration with NinjaTrader. 
 
## Completed Components 
- [x] Project repository and structure setup 
- [x] Express server with basic routing 
- [x] MongoDB connection and integration 
- [x] Template model schemas (ATM and Flazh) 
- [x] Basic API endpoints for template management 
- [x] GitHub backup integration 
- [x] MarketDataExporter indicator for NinjaTrader (preexisting) 
- [x] Market data service for integration with NinjaTrader 
- [x] Market news monitoring service 
- [x] Backtesting module for strategy testing 
- [x] Risk management dashboard API 
- [x] Trading journal integration 
- [x] Performance analytics 
- [x] Alert system 
- [x] System health monitoring 
- [x] Template import and validation functionality 
- [x] React dashboard with template recommendations 
- [x] Trading session analysis components 
- [x] Integration of market data and news into recommendation engine 
- [x] Comprehensive system testing with real market data 
 
## In Progress 
- [ ] Refining recommendation algorithms based on backtesting results 
- [ ] Developing user documentation and usage guides 
 
## Next Steps 
1. Implement multi-instrument support beyond NQ futures 
2. Create data archiving and cleanup routines for database maintenance 
3. Enhance mobile access and notifications 
 
## Environment Setup 
- Node.js server at C:\TradingDashboard\server 
- MongoDB running locally at mongodb://localhost:27017/trading-dashboard 
- NinjaTrader with MarketDataExporter indicator installed 
- MarketDataExporter writes to C:\NinjaTraderData\VolatilityMetrics.json 
- Requires the database to be running for full functionality 
 
## System Data Flow 
This project follows a specific data flow that must be maintained in all code modifications: 
 
1. **Data Collection**: NinjaTrader with MarketDataExporter indicator exports market data to `C:\NinjaTraderData\VolatilityMetrics.json` 
 
2. **Data Processing**: The server (`marketDataService.js`) reads this JSON file and processes the data 
 
3. **MongoDB Storage**: Processed data is stored in MongoDB collections (marketdatas, templates, etc.) 
 
4. **Template Selection**: When recommendations are needed: 
   - Current market conditions are analyzed (`marketConditionsService.js`) 
   - MongoDB is queried for matching templates (`enhancedTemplateSelector.js`)  
   - Best templates are selected based on similarity scoring 
   - Recommendations are returned through API endpoints 
 
This architecture allows the system to learn and improve over time based on historical data and performance. Any code changes must maintain this flow and never implement permanent bypass solutions that use mock data instead of real database access.
