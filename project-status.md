# TradingDashboard Project Status 
Last updated: Sat 03/22/2025 16:51:12.49 
 
## Project Description 
This is a trading system for recommending Flazh Infinity parameters and ATM settings based on market conditions for NinjaTrader 8, focusing on NQ futures. 
 
## Instructions for Assistants 
IMPORTANT - Please read these notes carefully before helping: 
 
- I am not a coder and get confused easily with technical jargon 
- When sharing code changes, please provide complete files rather than snippets to replace 
- Take things slow and easy, focusing on one task at a time 
- Do not overload me with multiple blocks of code all at once 
- Always include the exact full file path when I need to create new files 
- Be explicit about file locations and command line instructions 
- After completing a task, I will show you a list of newly created files to verify correct locations 
- After task completion, we will run system tests to ensure everything is functioning properly 
- I want to work on one item at a time - please don't try to implement multiple features simultaneously 
- When providing code, list the file name, path, and complete code block 
- If a file's code is very long, separate it into 2 or more logical blocks with clear instructions on where to place each block 
- This prevents chat sessions from stopping mid-code and makes implementation easier 
- Before making changes to existing files, ask to see the current file contents first to ensure compatibility 
- Review the current project structure and state before suggesting new implementations 
- Suggest any necessary preparation steps before adding new features to avoid system errors 
- Remember I am not even a novice coder, so explain concepts very simply and proceed carefully 
 
## Post-Task Verification 
For each completed task: 
1. Run 'dir [new_directory] /s /b' to verify new files are in the correct location 
2. Run appropriate system tests (when applicable): 
   - For server components: 'npm test' or 'node server.js' to verify functionality 
   - For database updates: Verify MongoDB connections and data integrity 
   - For API endpoints: Test with Postman or curl commands 
 
## Project Structure 
The project is organized in a modular architecture with server components and integration with NinjaTrader. 
 
## Completed Components 
- [x] Project repository and structure setup 
- [x] Express server with basic routing 
- [x] MongoDB connection and integration 
- [x] Template model schemas (ATM and Flazh) 
- [x] Basic API endpoints for template management 
- [x] GitHub backup integration 
- [x] MarketDataExporter indicator for NinjaTrader (preexisting) 
- [x] Market data service for integration with NinjaTrader 
- [x] Market news monitoring service 
- [x] Backtesting module for strategy testing 
- [x] Risk management dashboard API 
- [x] Trading journal integration 
- [x] Performance analytics 
- [x] Alert system 
- [x] System health monitoring 
- [x] Template import and validation functionality 
- [x] React dashboard with template recommendations 
 
## In Progress 
- [x] Trading session analysis components 
- [x] Parameter optimization logic 
- [x] Integration of market data and news into recommendation engine 
 
## Next Steps 
1. Conduct comprehensive system testing with real market data 
2. Refine recommendation algorithms based on backtesting results 
3. Develop user documentation and usage guides 
4. Implement multi-instrument support beyond NQ futures 
5. Create data archiving and cleanup routines for database maintenance 
6. Enhance mobile access and notifications 
 
## Environment Setup 
- Node.js server at C:\TradingDashboard\server 
- MongoDB running locally at mongodb://localhost:27017/trading-dashboard 
- NinjaTrader with MarketDataExporter indicator installed 
- MarketDataExporter writes to C:\NinjaTraderData\VolatilityMetrics.json 
- Requires the database to be running for full functionality
