## Instructions for Assistants 
IMPORTANT - Please read these notes carefully before helping: 
 
- I am not a coder and get confused easily with technical jargon 
- When sharing code changes, please provide complete files rather than snippets to replace 
- Take things slow and easy, focusing on one task at a time 
- Do not overload me with multiple blocks of code all at once 
- Always include the exact full file path when I need to create new files 
- Be explicit about file locations and command line instructions 
 
## Project Structure 
The project is organized in a modular architecture with server components. 
 
## Completed Components

## In Progress 
- [ ] Template import and validation functionality 
- [ ] Trading session analysis components
