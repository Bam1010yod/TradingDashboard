# TradingDashboard Project Status 
Last updated: Thu 03/20/2025 20:54:38.59 
 
## Project Description 
This is a trading system for recommending Flazh Infinity parameters and ATM settings based on market conditions for NinjaTrader 8, focusing on NQ futures. 
 
## Instructions for Assistants 
IMPORTANT - Please read these notes carefully before helping: 
 
- I am not a coder and get confused easily with technical jargon 
- When sharing code changes, please provide complete files rather than snippets to replace 
- Take things slow and easy, focusing on one task at a time 
- Do not overload me with multiple blocks of code all at once 
- Always include the exact full file path when I need to create new files 
- Be explicit about file locations and command line instructions 
- After completing a task, I will show you a list of newly created files to verify correct locations 
- After task completion, we will run system tests to ensure everything is functioning properly 
 
## Post-Task Verification 
For each completed task: 
1. Run 'dir [new_directory] /s /b' to verify new files are in the correct location 
2. Run appropriate system tests (when applicable): 
   - For server components: 'npm test' or 'node server.js' to verify functionality 
   - For database updates: Verify MongoDB connections and data integrity 
   - For API endpoints: Test with Postman or curl commands 
 
## Project Structure 
The project is organized in a modular architecture with server components and integration with NinjaTrader. 
 
## Completed Components 
- [x] Project repository and structure setup 
- [x] Express server with basic routing 
- [x] MongoDB connection and integration 
- [x] Template model schemas (ATM and Flazh) 
- [x] Basic API endpoints for template management 
- [x] GitHub backup integration 
- [x] MarketDataExporter indicator for NinjaTrader (preexisting) 
- [x] Market data service for integration with NinjaTrader 
- [x] Prop firm monitoring service 
- [x] Market news monitoring service 
- [x] Backtesting module for strategy testing 
- [x] Risk management dashboard API 
- [x] Trading journal integration 
- [x] Performance analytics 
- [x] Alert system 
- [x] System health monitoring 
 
## In Progress 
- [ ] Template import and validation functionality 
- [ ] Trading session analysis components 
- [ ] Parameter optimization logic 
- [ ] React dashboard with control buttons 
- [ ] Integration of market data, prop firm rules, and news into recommendation engine 
 
## Next Steps 
1. Create test XML files to verify template import functionality 
2. Implement market condition analysis for different trading sessions 
3. Develop parameter recommendation algorithms 
4. Begin building React frontend with control buttons for NinjaTrader interaction 
5. Connect market data, prop firm rules, and news services to the recommendation engine 
 
## Environment Setup 
- Node.js server at C:\TradingDashboard\server 
- MongoDB running locally at mongodb://localhost:27017/trading-dashboard 
- NinjaTrader with MarketDataExporter indicator installed 
- MarketDataExporter writes to C:\NinjaTraderData\VolatilityMetrics.json 
- Requires the database to be running for full functionality
