PARAMETER OPTIMIZATION REFINEMENT DOCUMENTATION
===========================================

Generated: 3/22/2025, 4:34:11 PM

OVERVIEW
--------
This document outlines the refinements made to the parameter optimization algorithm
based on analysis of test results. The goal is to improve recommendation accuracy
and confidence levels, particularly for specific market conditions.

CHANGES MADE
-----------
1. Updated session-specific parameters for the OVERNIGHT session:
   - Increased FastPeriod to 24
   - Set FastRange to 3
   - Increased MediumPeriod to 48
   - Increased SlowPeriod to 85

2. Enhanced volatility-based parameter adjustments:
   - Added special handling for OVERNIGHT sessions with MEDIUM_VOLATILITY
   - Increased stop loss multiplier for high volatility conditions
   - Refined range adjustments for different volatility levels

3. Improved confidence calculation:
   - Added a score-based confidence calculation system
   - Incorporated market conditions into confidence assessment
   - Added adjustments based on historical data availability
   - Created more granular confidence levels

EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS
---------------------
These changes are expected to improve the system in the following ways:

1. More accurate parameter recommendations for overnight trading sessions
2. Better handling of different volatility conditions
3. More reliable confidence assessments
4. Improved risk management through dynamic parameter adjustment

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Collect more historical trading data, especially for overnight sessions
2. Conduct additional tests with varied market conditions
3. Monitor performance of the refined algorithm
4. Consider further refinements for specific market scenarios

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
-----------------------
The changes have been implemented in the parameterOptimizationService.js file.
A backup of the original file has been saved in the backups directory.

For future enhancements, consider:
- Implementing machine learning for parameter prediction
- Adding adaptive adjustment based on recent performance
- Creating more specialized parameter sets for edge cases
